                     Sigurd's danger level: 75%
                      
                     Scientific name: Papio-volturius
                    
                     Baboon hawks are a primate of the family Cercopithecidae. They are hunchbacked but can stand up to 8 feet on average. 
                     Their heads are boney, with bird-like beaks and long horns, which they use like skewers to gore and feed on prey. 
                     Their horns are made of keratin instead of bone like the rest of their skulls, and they do not contain nerves or blood vessels. 
                     As a result, baboon hawks can often break their horns from the force they apply, then fully regrow them within the same season. Baboon hawks partly
                     owe their name to their large wings, which could never carry their large body mass and are used instead for intimidation and protection from the elements.
                  
                     The largest baboon hawk troop ever observed was made up of 18 baboon hawks. They are loosely territorial, and much of their behavior is motivated by intimidation and display. 
                     They can become collectors, using any flashy or colorful object to mark their territory. As lone scouts, baboon hawks are generally timid and won't attack unless provoked. 
                     In greater numbers they can become a great danger; sticking close to others and making yourself seem dangerous is the best ways to prevent an attack.
                     They prefer smaller mammals, but when desperate they are known to use their numbers to attack animals even twice their size, such as eyeless dogs. THEY TOOK M Y PICKLES

                  There is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin 
                  the color and texture of a red beet. 
                  The name is coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine. The purpose of these is believed 
                  to be for intimidation, however not much is known about 
                  the specifics of bracken behavior due to its elusiveness and low population.

                  We know a little from accounts by wildlife experts who have encountered it. It is a lone hunter with high intelligence. 
                  Its behavior can seem aloof; it exhibits high aggression even when unprovoked, yet quickly backs off when confronted. However, brackens are known to up 
                  their hostility when cornered or simply watched for a long time. It's theorized that upon death their bodies undergo
                   a rapid decomposition process which is unique from other large animals.

                      Bunker spiders, of the genus Theraphosa, are the largest arachnid found in the Thistle Nebula and the second largest ever discovered. It's believed they evolved 
                      to prey on large mammals over the course of a measly several hundred years after 
                      the Boat made its trip around the Thistle Nebula. (Refer to: Speculation on Increased Speciation Around the Fading Nebulae)
                  
                      Bunker spiders produce silk and lay it around their chosen nesting area, then wait for it to be tripped on. They can be seen waiting on walls, often over doorways where prey could enter unaware. If you find a bunker spider 'unprepared' 
                      it may freeze as a defensive reaction. In this case they are best left alone. If a bunker spider reacts aggressively, it is best not to fight with ordinary tools. They use their webs 
                      to make up for their rather slow movement, so take note of your surroundings. Their webs can be broken easily with any blunt tool.
                      
                      Bunker spiders can pose a great danger to humans and urban explorers especially, without a great benefit to their ecosystems. A resulting kill-on-sight order has been informally 
                      agreed upon between many states home to the Bunker spider, and it is currently approved by the ITDA as of 10/6/1965.

                  quite recognizable from their hairy, red bodies and two sets of wings. Like their ancestors, they are well-known for their intelligent 
                  social BEEhavior, large colony size, building wax nests which they use to store honey, and their important role in pollination. Unlike the honey bee, which often chose 
                  high places such as trees to construct its hive, red bees create their hives on the ground.

                  Red bees are highly defensive. They will leave the nest to attack any creature that comes 
                  within several meters, leaving BEEhind only the queen and drone bees. This bold BEEhavior is enabled by their most defining

                  of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to

                  the adult male typically hunts and forages while the female protects the ground nest. They are fiercely protective mothers, partly due to their opportunistic

                  prey out of sight and usually in the comfort of the Vain shrouds. It usually chooses to lie low and wait for things to come its way. But if it grows restless, it can use its long, sticky tongue 
                  to snatch its prey from great distances and drag them as far as it needs. If there are Vain shrouds in your area, carry a weapon and do not stray far from others; its tongue is quite soft and fragile and can be struck easily, forcing it

                  The Maneater has been linked to a genus of cockroaches known as Periplaneta. It was first nicknamed by workers of the Caswella Mine, one of 
                  many copper mines along the asteroid belt of Lepus, in 1951. The Caswella Mine had begun to languish since the end of wartime and would soon close after operating for twelve years; working 
                  conditions had worsened long before the rumor of the Maneater had begun to spread, and as a result, it was not taken seriously by the higher ups or media at the time. On June 23 of that year, however, an eviscerated 
                  corpse was rescued from the lowest level of Caswella Mine. It was later identified as Brett Goldent, a senior mining operator. Autopsy recorded the death an accident resulting from faulty equipment. However the story became 
                  a sensation, and the Maneater rose up as a famous myth until six years later, when it would be first recorded in the DEEP57 cave expedition headed by Simon Goldent to put to rest the mystery of his father's death. This was a revelation to the scientific world, as it is 
                  now known as the largest troglobite (cave-dwelling species). A creature of this size confined to underground caves was thought impossible. Simon Goldent, who had seeked to disprove the myth, described his discovery as "traumatic."

                  Periplaneta clamorus is thought to live off of mainly plant debri and animal carcasses, both of which can be carried into the caves by running water. It seems to have never 
                  developed the instinctive fear of larger predators while living underground. Thus, as a larva it may be fascinated or indifferent to human presence. However, as larvae, they can react fearfully to loud noises or to the sight 
                  of blood and injury. Some researchers have observed the larvae to show signs of loneliness.

                  Being unhappy or afraid seems to exacerbate Periplaneta clamorus' symptoms of growth. Its metamorphosis is remarkably sudden and is a 
                  dangerous phenomenon to observe. The most telling sign that a larva is approaching metamorphosis is an excretion of an acidic, foamy liquid at its lower jaw; this substance is believed to be a catalyst and exits 
                  its body in large quantities once metamorphosis begins.

                  An adult can move incredibly fast and is capable of creating loud noise by clicking its mandibles at high frequency. In an encounter with Periplaneta clamorus, recommended procedure 
                  is to back away slowly and keep your distance, as it seems to wait for you to approach and avoids line of sight. Stopping and exhaling suddenly while arching its legs backwards 
                  is a sign that an adult is entering chase. God help[ you

                  The Old Bird is an autonomous, offensive weapon of war with a humanoid design. Measured at 19 feet tall and 11 feet wide, its two most defining visual 
                  features are the spotlight positioned on its head, capable of emitting 100,000 lumens, and the long-range acoustic device on its chest, sometimes referred 
                  to as a sound cannon. There are additional speakers 
                  on its shoulders used to broadcast sound a long distance. The Old Bird's left arm is a claw, and its right arm 
                  is a nozzle capable of both launching rocket-propelled grenades and torching 
                  at close-range with a very hot flame. Old Birds are one of the first 
                  extra-orbital weapons to be used and mass-produced.

                  The subject of who developed the Old Birds has been an intense debate since their first recorded appearance on 
                  December 18 of 2143, when over fifty Old Birds invaded the Anglen Capital. This is considered one of the first major causes for the downfall of the Anglen Empire. The most 
                  commonly upheld theory takes into account the tension between the Anglen and Buemoch military throughout the 2100's, however nothing has been proven in the centuries since. 
                  The design of the Old Bird, down to the tempering of metals, appears 
                  intended to conceal its origin. It has been called the "walking ransom letter."

                  Old Birds' legs function as rockets, which allows them to travel long distances and find targets efficiently. But the most likely reason this feature 
                  exists is to help them enter and land from orbit. The material and fuel Old Birds rely on is similar to those of passenger space craft from around 2130.

                  Old Birds land and stay at their target planet forever. Although they often have more than enough fuel for just one trip, no behavior has been found in their programming which suggests they 
                  could choose to "migrate". Still, there are unverified accounts of Old Birds travelling autonomously to a new planet after hundreds of years of dormancy.

                  The Old Bird was historically referred to as the "Al", based off the code name it was given by the English military, the "A16-L31". In 2384, however, the song "Old Birds" released as a cult hit by the post-punk project Under Remora; just three years 
                  later, in his most famous work of the same name, street artist Land Eyrie depicted the automotons flying and landing between planets in an arrangement similar to a flock of geese--this is generally considered one of the most iconic and influential images of 
                  modern culture and solidified the modern nickname.

                  In 2356, 5-Embrion was classified as Condemned for the purposes of travel or settlement by the Boat; Old Birds were described by witness accounts as "lining the horizon". Though to this day they appear 
                  inoperative, there is a reasonable risk that many are still in sleep mode, so the planet will likely keep its status. The small moon was likely used as a testing ground for the Old Bird's flying and landing capabilities.

                  Colloquially named Puffers or Spore Lizards, Lacerta-glomerorum (of the family Alligatoridae) is one of the largest and heaviest reptiles. Despite their 
                  large mouths, they are herbivores and do not have a strong bite. The bulbs on their tails are believed to secrete a chemical which attracts and accelerates the growth of the fungus 
                  species Lycoperdon perlatum, which it can then shake to release spores as a defense mechanism--an unique example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.

                  Spore Lizards have a very timid temperament, avoiding confrontation if at all possible. If their attempts at threat display 
                  are not effective, they may attempt to attack. It is therefore not recommended to corner or chase one. There are historical records that Spore Lizards were at least partially domesticated hundreds of years ago, however this effort 
                  was set aside by an initiative to harvest their tails for their medicinal properties.

                  Halves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their 
                  bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact that they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs 
                  are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.

                  They are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are 
                  leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can't easily track prey.

                  Due to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that Halves are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations 
                  causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.

                  Scientific name: Draco tulipa

                  Tulip snakes, or tulip lizards, are a type of flying lizard which are easily distinguished by their long arms and wings, which can reach twice the size of other members 
                  of their genus (Draco) and sport unusually bright colors and patterns. Their name comes from the flaps under their neck and behind their head, 
                  which resemble large flower petals. (Their other unusual characteristics include 
                  an extra pair of eyes and a deeply forked tail.)

                  Their behaviour is stubborn and fearless to a fault. Indeed, tulip snakes will rarely 
                  flee a predator. But ironically, many biologists theorize that their flowery appearance aids them more as a camoflauge than an intimidation display. It also takes an important part in 
                  their elaborate courtship rituals, which are more similar to that of birds.

                  Uniquely, lifting heavy and large objects into the air has often been observed as a part of the tulip snake's 
                  mating display; they are capable of carrying rocks and plants at least twice their size in an effort to impress their potential mate. Protective, jealous, and in a frenzy, the males may end 
                  up tug-of-war fights over objects they take a liking to, which can even include other living creatures.

                 In ideal conditions, Vain Shrouds' fronds can reach a height of 8 feet, though they average 6'11'', and are 30-50 centimeters wide. 
                 Their roots are unusually large, and they are somewhat SOMEWHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTprickly.


                 With their aggressive reproduction and remarkable size, they take up a lot of space, making visibility 
                 difficult, and are difficult to remove. They crowd out healthy plants and offer little nutritional value. They are also highly flammable. A strongly 
                 correlated mutualistic relationship has been observed between Vain Shrouds and the Kidnapper Fox, and for this reason Vains are a danger when they are allowed 
                 to expand to great numbers. Due to this and their other harmful effects on many ecosystems and agriculture, 
                 Vains have been classified as a noxious weed by the ITDA since 2147.




                 Their planet of origin is unknown, and they were first recorded by plant researcher Alex Kurt in CoRoT-7b in 2143 
                 before being found on the other side of its same interplanetary system just weeks later. A common myth is that the Vains were first

              the acciddent. they were too scared to do it. It was the same fake voice i 
              remember from the interview on the phone at home and the stupid training 
              videos. but it heard what i said i think, cause it said they would contact 
              the family and find a replacement and something e lse. It talked so fast.



              I learned you can hear the screams all the time in the walkie talkie when 
              you;re  at the wall of the Company building. they didnt believe me, well now 
              they do. It sounds just like when i heard it a couple weeks ago. They want 
              to quit. I said I'm not a coward. I just got this job
                                                                                                                          """)

              the past weekend it feels like Desmond and Jess woke up. we;re supposed to 
              get our fourth member of the crew in a few days. We arent taking any risks 
              anymore, we dont get as much but it feels safer, and ive gotten better 
              sleep. but its still ass. i can still smell Rich i swear to gosh he smelled 
              that bad



              i was talking about how the voice on the phone sounded fake. Then Desmond 
              got this weird idea. he's the wizard and all so he thinks theres a way to 
              use the phone call i made to the company number to find ourt where the voice 
              comes from. i dont know why hed want to do that but he seems serious. He;s 
              been using the terminal a lot.

              desmond wants me to writ e down what we figured out and keep my "nonsense to 
              a minimum". So im going to put SO MUCH of my non sense. screw him. The new 
              crew member is named Lucas and he is so confused and scared a ll the time, 
              what a baby, at least he doesnt smell like a monster. its been so sunny even 
              though its september, and these suits dont take it well

              ok so desmond "traced the call" and found out theres a group of people 
              somewhere else that pretends to call us from the company building. they are 
              across the whole solar system !! why would they be so far away.



              Desmond says he doesnt know, but i think. What if there really is a big 
              monster in the company building like the voice told me on the wlakie talkie? 
              They trapped it, and we feed it to keep it tame.

              i keep having bad dreams about the Company building where the Company breaks 
              out of that giant concrete wall. But i dont know if it looks like anything, 
              i just think its really fast, and its so big it covers the sky. We cant 
              figure out a way to know if the voices on the phone are real, desmond says 
              its too far away. i asked him if he could ttake control of the autopilot and 
              he said im crazy and that could kill us. yes i am crazy desmond


              he says we would have to get our own private flight to go to the cordinates, 
              and who knows what would actually be there. So, what if its nothing?

              i started wondering how i cant remember how we really got here, no I just 
              remember little things like the shuttle flight to the building where we 
              signed our contracts. But i dont remember getting on the shuttle, i dont 
              even remember saying bye to dad. sometmies i feel this deep pit in my 
              stomache and i have to think just to remember my name. in my dreams it feels 
              like the company isnt trapped in there at all, its just hiding. I dont know

              are "more benefficial and economic" well if he puts off ordering my stuff 
              for another day, im going to take a crap on the control lever and ask him

              i know im not the wizard but I guess im the computer guy again today. every 
              time i go outside on vow they say i get pale like im dead, so they put me on 
              screen duty. they think i got soft or something. whatever, Mr. Doofus Lucas 
              is the scared one. good luck keeping him from losing his freaking mind. I 
              could stroll out at night like its my back yard!! Its just that i saw Rich 
              on a hill. he was over on the orther side of the river. but that was three 
              days ago. Im not scared, its just getting cold outside. i think they jus 
              twant me to have screen duty every day now, and they all got an excuse



              i miss dad. i hope he isnt staying on titan. people are saying its not going 
              to look the same in two years. jess told us they a re about to go to war and 
              everyone is just waiting for it. every time we go to sell, the company 
              building is shaking like theres a loud furnace inside. we can barely sleep 
              to meet the quota, and it gets worse every time. God, i feel like im being 
              squeezed through a needle. i wish we could go back. it was better working 
              for Dad even when i got nothing, just daily alowance. i liked when he would 
              drive us out of town to see the waterfall and we walked up those old wooden 
              stairs. I just wanted a real job

             I havent felt like writing. no time. but last night
             I swear i heard dad talking to me from the vent,
             the one under the charger. i dont feel crazy. Man,
             thats what they all say, yea yea i know! Well, im

             write about it. he was asking where he was,
             breathing really deep like he couldnt breath, like
             he was getting pulled into the engine. he sounded
             scared. he said he was thirsty


             i never heard dad like that. maybe i just dont get
             enugh sleep. jeesh, how am i gona do it now. maybe
             i should just open the thing up and look.


             maybe its cause Im feeling bad, cause we sold the
             baby bird we stole from that giant wingless one
             that's always stink-eyeing us on Vow. Man it could
             run thouggh, we had to leave on the spot, and Mr.
             Doofus Lucas has been chattering his teeth ever
             since. im not doing that again.
             They made ME< put the baby bird on the desk. I
             think I shouldn't have done it. i know why they
             made me do it now.... theyre even more guilty than
             i am. cowards. So i went and told it to desmond's
             face. Do your own dirty work.

             He went all dumb and and said guilty what? For
             selling the baby bird egg!Then, i cant belive it,
             he said it's no different than the eggs you eat for
             breakfast. i said it BROKE OUT AND LOOKED AT US,
             and i wouldnt eat that! it was ALIVE. And then,
             what he said. "could it carry scrap? could it get
             us to the quota? could it raise our efficiency and
             throughputt and enhance our team synergy, could it

             like the voice in the company phone. Then he just
             heaved a big breath like he was satisfied and went
             back to work, like he won the argument. ill kill
             him!! desmond why don't i put you on the desk, like

              Date: October 13, 1968
              This is Desmond. Sigurd is unable to write. But I feel the need to keep a 
              record, and none of us are sleeping tonight. After the incident, he's 
              practically catatonic. He says he heard his father's voice in the air intake 
              vent under the charger several days ago; I wish he'd told us before the 
              incident, but I'm liable to believe he's being honest at least to himself. 
              In this state he'd be a danger to himself and others, so we've been reduced 
              to a three-man crew--a hard blow I'm afraid we can't afford.


              This is how Jess and Lucas recounted it. There was a scraping sound, of 
              which they soon located the vent as the source. They took this as a sign of 
              the ship needing maintenance and perhaps an oil change. Lucas went to grab 
              the tools just to check. However before he returned, the vent burst with a 
              chunky, red fluid, with what were almost surely bits of bone and hair, which 
              spread across the floor, like the contents of a clogged toilet. Fully 
              emptying the vent, cleaning out the ship, and eradicating the stench was a 
              challenge I wouldn't wish on anyone, especially with Sigurd trying to stop 
              us. Now the smell of bleach burning our nostrils is a relief.


              Why? Why did it happen? I cannot reasonably entertain Sigurd's "explanation" 
              that somehow his father was inside the ship. He has always been quite 
              imaginative, not to mention his current state. I believe the crew before us-
              -or the crew before that--is simply responsible for attempting to avoid a 
              fine, and the method was to hide their mistake. The victim's remains have 
              been dumped out, and we will never identify them.


              It doesn't matter. As I stated, this is unsustainable. I have followed every 
              step of the handbook. I have tried to make things work. I have maximized our 
              efficiency. I have kept our morale in check. Now, even I am wringing my 
              hands. It's like this job is just designed to break me! I've done everything 
              right, I've done everything I can, and still, we would have to pull a 
              miracle just to get back on track. The only course of action left is to do 
              what I cannot. So maybe I will.



              I will hand in my letter of resignation personally. It's time to see who 
              we've been working for. No, Sigurd, this is not our real job. Our work has 
              just begun. And there is no way out but further in.
